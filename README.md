Hello,

This repository contains the C# codes i write in my freetime for practice purposes. Each folder in the repository is named after the source where i got my practice tasks from, for example "edabit_codes" are from website: https://edabit.com/challenges/csharp.

Every task has a uniqe folder where the code can be found and an image which contains the task.
